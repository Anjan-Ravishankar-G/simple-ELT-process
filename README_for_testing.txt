The  firstpart_fortesting.py file is the slightly modified original source code used for testing purpose,

we import this firstpart_fortesting.py file to Testfirstpart_fortesting.py which is a testframe work based on PYTEST.

so we have to run the Testfirstpart_fortesting.py file and provide command as

<pytest Testfirstpart_fortesting.py> in the terminal to execute the file.
